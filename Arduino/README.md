# This is the Arduino side of "TurretProject"

## Arduino requirements:
2 Servo motors

## Instruction:
Connect your servo motors to Arduino pins 8 and 9, pin 8 should be attached to your horizontally moving Servo, and 9 to your vertically moving one.
(Any stand which would support two Servo motors to move should suffice)
