# About TurretProject
"Turret" is a Python-Arduino project that uses facial recognition python libraries to detect and track human faces in real-time.
Once a face is identified, the Arduino-controlled Nerf dart shooter automatically aims and fires a Nerf dart at the target. 
An interactive and engaging project that combines facial recognition and robotics for fun and entertainment.

## Note:
The project is divided into two parts, the Python code and Arduino code(Which can be found under "Arduino" folder)
